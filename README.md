# Readme

This crack was originally used, and I didn't plan to make it public  
But when I used the FAHAI cracked version of AWVS yesterday, I saw such a sentence:  
`Thank's Fahai && Open Source ENTHUSIAST`

So I was thinking, I used so many open source projects, how many contributions did I make?  
I simply disclose this project, which can also be considered a little contribution to the Internet security  
If there is no accident, it will continue to be updated, after all, I also need to use  
~~Don't get the automatic update plug -in version, use it first!~~  
I had release auto-update version, check Update log!

The Original Intention of the Project is in the Spirit of Open Source  
We can do a little thing for open source, for the world!
